Learning Data Structures and Algorithms is important in Computer Science because they allow you to solve challenging problems.

Data Structures and Algorithms Resources that I have used:

1. Data Structures & Algorithms in Python Book - Goodrich
2. The Algorithm Design Manual - Steven Skiena
3. [CS Dojo youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBZBJbE_rGRV8D7XZ08LK6z-4zPoWzu5H)

# Algorithms:

### Sorting Algorithms

[Insertion Sort](https://devintheengineer.com/algorithms/insertion)

[Merge Sort](https://devintheengineer.com/algorithms/merge)

[Quick Sort](https://devintheengineer.com/algorithms/quick)

[Bubble Sort](https://devintheengineer.com/algorithms/bubble)


Project using Sorting Algorithms coming soon!


### Sorting Algorithm Complexity

| Algorithm      | Running Time (Average) | Running Time (Worst) | Space Complexity (Worst) |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| QuickSort      | (n log(n))             | O (n^2)              | O(n log(n))              |
| Insertion Sort | (n)                    | O (n^2)              | O(1)                     |
| Merge Sort     | (n log(n))             | O(n log(n))          | O(n)                     |
| Bubble Sort    | (n)                    | O (n^2)              | O(1)                     |
