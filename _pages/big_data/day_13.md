### What is A/B Testing ?

* A/B testing is a method for comparing 2 verisions of something against each other to discover which is *more* successful.


### What is Multivariate Testing?

* Multivariate Testing is just an expansion of A/B testing in which *more than* two versions are compared and more variation is included, in which you can test multiple items at once and see how they interact together.

```python

for i in range(100):
    print(i)

```
