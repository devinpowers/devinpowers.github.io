# General Trees

![inserting an Image](/images/tree/general_tree.jpg)

Trees are a non-linear Data Structure, compared to arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data strcutures

Tree Node Class:

    class Node:
    
        def __int__(self, data):

            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.data = data
