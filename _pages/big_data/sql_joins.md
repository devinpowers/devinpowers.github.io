# JOINS in SQL

# Joins

- Interview Questions!!

* INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, AND RIGHT JOIN

- A **JOIN** clause is used to *combine rows* from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.


### INNER JOIN

The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in *both tables*.

**INNER JOIN Syntax**


```sql
SELECT Column_Name(s)
FROM Table_1
INNER JOIN Table_2
ON Table_1.Column_Name = Table_2.Column_Name
```


Example of an INNER JOIN:


### LEFT JOIN

### RIGHT JOIN


**NOTE:** A Full join isnt supported in MySQL or SQLite which I've used the most
