I plan on starting to learn C++ in 2021. (maybe the end of 2020)


I plan on posting notes here with some basic projects to show understanding of concepts in C++

and some other stuff!!!!
### Introduction Basics

[Intro to C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/intro_c++)

- Variables, Literals, and Constants
- Data Types (Int, Strings, Char)
- Basic Input and Output
- Type Conversion

[Operators to C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/operators_c++)


- Operators (adding, dividing, etc)

[Inputting and Outputting in C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/input_c++)

- Inputting and Outputting in C++


### Flow Control

[Control in C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/control_c++)

- if statements, for loops, switch, and while loops 
- break and continue


### Functions

[Functions in C++ ](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/functions_cpp)

- Intro to Functions
- Function Types and Overloading
- Function Return
- Recursion


### Basic Data Structures

[Arrays](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/arrays)

[STL Arrays](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/stl_arrays)

[Working with Strings in C++](https://devintheengineer.com/C++/c++_strings)
