Hello, I'm doing a take-home data science assignment for a company and they've given me a dataset with some questions to answer. The dataset is similar to one below.  They want to understand what features/characteristic are important to the business regarding if a customer will renew their lease or not. They want a simple analysis using core probability and statistical theory to draw insights and conclusions to the business. The dataset is given in terms of binary (1 or 0) with 1 being true and 0 being no/false.
The problem is I have never worked with a Binary Dataset so I'm unsure of what kinds of tests I should run to draw up simple conclusions. I'm working in a Juypter notebook (pandas, seaborm, bumpy, matplotlib, sklearn). I would appreciate it if someone could help lead me in a direction to what kind of simple analysis I can run on binary data.
