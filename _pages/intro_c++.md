Working with Variables in C++

    #include <iostream>

    int main()

    {
        int points = 5;

        std::cout << "I scored " << points << "points" << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }

Here the points value is return as 5.

You can change the value of the varible points

    #include <iostream>

    int main()

    {
        int points = 5;

        points = 10;

        std::cout << "I scored " << points << " points" << std::endl;

        return 0;
    }

Here the points value is returned as 10.
