## Time Complexity of Hash Tables

| Operation | Running Time (Average) | Running Time (Worst) |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------|
| Space     | O(n)                   | O(n)                 |
| Search    | O(1)                   | O(n)                 |
| Insert    | O(1)                   | O(n)                 |
| Delete    | O(1)                   | O(n)                 |

## Advantages of Hash Tables

- Speed
- Set of key-value pairs is fixed and known ahead of time, which reduces the average lookup cost


## Drawbacks
