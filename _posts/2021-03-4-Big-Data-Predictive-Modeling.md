**What is Predictive Modeling/Analytics?**

Predictive Modeling/Analytics involves manipulations on data from exisiting data sets with the goal of **identifying some new trends or patterns**, in which are used to *predict* future outcomes and trends.

**Why is Predictive Analysis Important?**

Well we use historical data to predict future outcomes, thus it improves decision making and helps increase profit rates of business/engineering (KPIs).

Predictive Analysis can be used in many fields (domains) including:

- Online Retail
- Engineering
- Eduction
- Predicting Weather Forecasting
- Social Media Analysis


**What are the Steps to Perform Predictive Analysis?**

1. Define Problem Statement
2. Collect Data
3. Clean Data
4. Data Analysis
5. Build a Predictive Model
6. Validate the Model
7. Deployment of the Model
8. Monitor the Model


**Predictive Modeling**

* The task of predicting the value of a target variable (y) as a function of the predictor variables (X)

y = f(X)
