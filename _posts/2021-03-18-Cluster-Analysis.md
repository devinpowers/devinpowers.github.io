## Introduction of Cluster Analysis

**What is Clustering?**

* Clustering is dividing up the population of data points into groups that are more similar to other data points in the same group



**What is K-Means Clustering?**

* K-Means Clustering is a popular way

**What is Cluster Validation?**


**Why Clustering over Classification?**

* Clustering can adapt to changes made and helps *single out* useful features that differentiate different groups


### Examples of using Clustering

| Data          	| Attribute Set (x)                    	| Clustering Task                        	|
|---------------	|--------------------------------------	|----------------------------------------	|
| Customer      	| Demographic and Location Information 	| Group together similar customers       	|
| Word Document 	| Words                                	| Group Documents based on similar words 	|


### Clustering Methods

* Partitioning Method

- K-Means all all its variants (Fuzzy k-means aka similar words)
- Support Vector Clustering

* Model-Based Method

* Heirarchial Method




## K-Means Clustering

- One of the more popular "clustering" algorithms, K-Means stores centroids that it uses to define clusters. A point is considered to be in a particular cluster if its close to that cluster's centroid than any other centroid.

### Errors with K-Means


### Limitations of K-Means

**When are there problems with K-Means Clustering?**

* When clusters are of differing Sizes, Densities, and Non-Globular Shapes
* When there are outliers in the Data
