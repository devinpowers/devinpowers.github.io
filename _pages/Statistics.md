## Collection of Stats notes and Homework (example problems)

* I followed along with Professor Leonard Statistics Lectures on Youtube. I use to watch his Calculus 1-3 in undergrad, one of the best Professors for math on the internet!

* I also used the book **Probability and Statistics for Engineering and the Sciences**

* Statistics is probabaly the *most important* **math** that is useful for any engineering or business job/career



### Chapter One: Descriptive Stats

* mean/median/mode

[Notes on Descriptive Stats](/Files/stats/Stats_Chapter_1.pdf)

### Chapter Two: Frequency Distribution and Histograms

* Histograms
* Relative Frequency

[Notes on Frequency Distribution and Histograms](/Files/stats/Stats_Chapter_2.pdf)


### Chapter Three: Discrete Random Variables and Probability Distributions

* Given an experiment and a sample space *S*, the objective of probability is to assign to each event A a number P(A), called the probability of the event A, which will give a precise measure of the chance the A will occur.

* Random Variables
* Binomial Probability Distribution

### Chapter Four: Continuous Random Variables and Probability Distributions

* Standard Normal Distribution
* Z-Scores (Standard Score)
* Central Limit Theorem

[Notes on Continuous Random Variables](/Files/stats/Stats_Chapter_4.pdf)


### Chapter Five: Joint Probability Distributions and Random Samples


### Chapter Six: Point Estimation

### Chapter Seven: Confidence Intervals

* Confidence interval for sample mean, population standard deviation -KNOWN
* Confidence interval for sample mean, population standard deviation -UNKNOWN
* Confidence interval for Variance and Standard Deviation Chi-Squared Distribution
