Discrete Mathematics is an important subject for any software developers. I've used my time duirng the COVID pandemic to learn about this subject. 

The resources that I have been using to learn Discrete Mathematics:

1. Discrete Mathematics and its Applications - Rosen 7th Edition
2. [thetrevtutor](https://trevtutor.com/discretemath/discretemath1/)
3. [Professor Kimberly Brehm Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3Ffwsnad0k&list=PLl-gb0E4MII28GykmtuBXNUNoej-vY5Rz)
